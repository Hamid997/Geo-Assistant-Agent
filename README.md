# Geo-Assistant-Agent
This notebook builds a **multi-agent Geo-Assistant** using **Python**, **Google’s ADK**, **Gemini models**, and **custom tools** to search geoscience data, **fetch API** for earthquake information, and generate final summaries.
It orchestrates several specialized agents (data research, earthquake analysis, summarization, chat manager) into one end-to-end geospatial research workflow.
